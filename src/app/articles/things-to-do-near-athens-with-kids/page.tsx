                        <p style={s.p}>Athens and the surrounding Attica region are a treasure trove of family-friendly experiences that go far beyond the Acropolis. If you are planning a summer 2026 holiday with your family and staying anywhere along the Athens Riviera or in Porto Rafti, you will find yourself surrounded by activities that delight children of every age. Here is our curated guide to the best things to do with kids in the area.</p>p>
                
                        <h2 style={s.h2}>1. Watch the Sunset at Cape Sounion</h2>h2>
                        <p style={s.p}>The Temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion is one of the most dramatic ancient sites in Greece, perched on a cliff 60 meters above the Aegean Sea. Children are fascinated by the mythological stories of Poseidon, and the sunset views from the temple are truly spectacular. The drive from Porto Rafti takes about 40 minutes along a scenic coastal road, making it an easy afternoon outing.</p>p>
                
                        <h2 style={s.h2}>2. Explore the Ancient Site of Brauron</h2>h2>
                        <p style={s.p}>Just 10 minutes from Porto Rafti, the archaeological site of Brauron is dedicated to the goddess Artemis. The museum houses fascinating artifacts, and the surrounding wetlands are home to a variety of birds. It is a peaceful, uncrowded site where children can roam freely and learn about ancient Greek religion and daily life.</p>p>
                
                        <h2 style={s.h2}>3. Spend a Day at Schinias Beach and National Park</h2>h2>
                        <p style={s.p}>Schinias Beach, about 30 minutes north of Porto Rafti, is one of the finest sandy beaches in Attica. The shallow, warm waters are perfect for young children, and the pine forest behind the beach provides welcome shade. The Schinias National Park also offers walking trails through wetlands where you can spot flamingos and other wildlife.</p>p>
                
                        <h2 style={s.h2}>4. Take a Ferry to the Greek Islands from Rafina</h2>h2>
                        <p style={s.p}>Rafina Port is just a 20-minute drive from Porto Rafti, opening the door to exciting island day trips. Fast ferries take your family to Evia in under an hour, or to Andros and Tinos in about two hours. Children love the excitement of a ferry ride, and you can combine the journey with lunch in a picturesque island harbor before heading back to your villa.</p>p>
                
                        <h2 style={s.h2}>5. Visit the Attica Zoological Park</h2>h2>
                        <p style={s.p}>One of the largest zoos in Europe, Attica Zoo is home to over 2,000 animals from 400 species. Located near Spata, it is about 20 minutes from Porto Rafti. The zoo features a dolphin show, a birds of prey exhibition, and themed areas including an African savannah habitat. It is an excellent full-day activity for families with younger children.</p>p>
                
                        <h2 style={s.h2}>6. Discover Lavrio and Its Maritime Heritage</h2>h2>
                        <p style={s.p}>The coastal town of Lavrio, about 25 minutes south of Porto Rafti, has a rich maritime and mining history. Families can visit the Mineralogical Museum, stroll along the waterfront promenade, and enjoy fresh seafood at tavernas overlooking the harbor. The nearby beaches at Sounio and Legrena are also excellent for a swim.</p>p>
                
                        <h2 style={s.h2}>7. Explore Athens with a Family Walking Tour</h2>h2>
                        <p style={s.p}>Athens itself is just 40 minutes away via the Attiki Odos highway. For families, we recommend focusing on the Plaka neighborhood, which sits at the foot of the Acropolis and feels like a village within the city. Children enjoy the narrow streets, ice cream shops, and the changing of the guard at Syntagma Square. The Acropolis Museum offers interactive exhibits that engage children in ancient history.</p>p>
                
                        <h2 style={s.h2}>8. Try Water Sports at Porto Rafti Bay</h2>h2>
                        <p style={s.p}>The calm waters of Porto Rafti Bay are ideal for stand-up paddleboarding, kayaking, and snorkeling. Several local operators offer equipment rental and lessons suitable for beginners and children. The bay is naturally protected from strong winds, making it a safe environment for kids to try water sports for the first time.</p>p>
                
                        <h2 style={s.h2}>9. Enjoy a Greek Cooking Class Together</h2>h2>
                        <p style={s.p}>Several local providers offer family cooking classes where you can learn to make traditional Greek dishes like spanakopita, tzatziki, and loukoumades. It is a wonderful bonding activity that gives your family a skill to take home. If you are staying at a villa with a full kitchen, you can recreate your favorite dishes during your holiday.</p>p>
                
                        <h2 style={s.h2}>10. Stargaze from Your Villa Terrace</h2>h2>
                        <p style={s.p}>Porto Rafti benefits from relatively low light pollution compared to central Athens. On a clear summer night, families can enjoy stargazing from the comfort of their villa terrace, spotting constellations over the Aegean. Properties like Villa Lithos, with their elevated position and panoramic sea views, offer an especially memorable setting for this experience.</p>p>
                
                        <h2 style={s.h2}>Make Porto Rafti Your Family Base</h2>h2>
                        <p style={s.p}>With so many activities within easy reach, Porto Rafti is the ideal base for a family summer holiday near Athens. Whether your children are toddlers or teenagers, the mix of culture, nature, beaches, and adventure will keep everyone engaged and create lasting memories.</p>p>
